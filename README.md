# tensorboard Tools

Here are a few crude but functional tensorboard file manipulation tools - they definitely could use some love (I adapted someone else' scripts) but they are good enough for an occasional use. Each script contains the usage and examples inside.

- [tb-remove-events-by-group.py](tb-remove-events-by-group.py) - remove whole sub-grops of events
- [tb-remove-events-by-tag.py](tb-remove-events-by-tag.py) - remove specific events by name
- [tb-rename-events.py](tb-rename-events.py) - rename events
